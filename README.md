**CanvasMC** is a fork of the Folia Minecraft server software that fixes gameplay inconsistencies, bugs, and introduces further performance enhancements to the dedicated server.

Canvas pulls some patches from [Leaf](https://github.com/Winds-Studio/Leaf) to assist in single-threaded performance, along with a ton of our own performance patches
